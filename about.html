					<p> <br>   ⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</br>
						I was born in Arequipa, Peru and immigrated to the United States in 2008 with my family when I was 7 years old. Like many freshly arrived immigrants, I faced the struggles of learning to speak a language unfamiliar to me, and feeling like I wasn’t accepted in my small city of Plano, Texas. There weren’t many hispanic students in my schools growing up and I found myself in an identity crisis of being embarrassed to speak Spanish in public but not feeling American enough for the rest of my classmates. The more I grew, the more I embraced the beauty and richness of my Hispanic culture and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.
					</p>
					<p>	I faced a lot of discrimination in my high school years, which pushed me toward a hunger for my academic success and making my presence known as a top student in my graduating class. I became President of my school’s National Mathematics Honors Society and the Treasurer and Secretary of Key Club amongst other extracurricular activities. Additionally, I gained professional experience from my internship with Asociar my junior year and with The Boeing Company my senior year of high school as one of only 5 selected high school interns for Boeing Global Services. 

					</p>
					<p>	As a sophomore Aerospace Engineering student under the Engineering Honors Program, I’m proud to further grow my leadership experiences as I’m an Engineering Team Lead for AggieSAT Laboratory where I work on projects to build cube satellites alongside my team or by being heavily involved in 2 committees as part of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. I love the organizations that I’m involved in and love to do everything that I do with a positive mindset as I’m always eager to learn new things everyday. I’m a life-long learner who is always ready to be a leader and make my name known wherever I go. I’m a leader, but a team-worker and never doubt asking a colleague for help or inspiring someone else to succeed. I credit my drive and will to always work hard to my parents who show me every day what hard work is.

						<h2> Immigrated to the United States from Peru</h2>
						<em>Aug 2008</em>
						<p>	
							In 2018, I moved to the US from Peru. I didn’t know any English, and didn’t have many friends in Elementary School from the language barrier.

						<h2>Started Martial Arts (Tae Kwon Do)</h2>
						<em>Oct 2008</em>
						<p>	
							Martial Arts has been a huge part of my life. Having done the sport for 10 years and being part of the competition team, Martial Arts has taught me discipline, consistency, and has formed me into the confident independent woman I am today. The main reason why I started Tae Kwon Do was to learn self defense as a young girl, but I gained leadership along the way as I became an assistant instructor and one of the few third degree Black Belts within my dojo.

						<h2>Attended Vines High School / Plano Senior High School</h2>
						<em>Aug 2015 - 2019</em>
						<p>	
							Going to a very competitive high school allowed me to form a competitive personality and value the importance of hard-work from a very young age. In high school I participated in FIRST Robotics for all 4 years of high school, served as President of my school’s chapter of Mu Alpha Theta (National Mathematics Honors Society), served as Treasurer and Secretary of KEY Club, and was heavily involved in Debate and Orchestra.

						<h2>Internship with The Boeing Company</h2>
						<em>Jun 2018 - Aug 2018</em>
						<p>	
							I was chosen as 1 of the 5 high school interns in the Boeing Global Services (BGS) Headquarters in Plano, Texas as part of a competitive program. This internship confirmed that I wanted to pursue Aerospace Engineering, and I value every single minute I got to work with this amazing company. I gained some impactful experience and worked as an intern for an amazing team, the Business Aviation/ General Aviation (BA/GA) team. I even got a letter of Recommendation from Stan Deal, the executive Vice President of Boeing!

					<li data-date="30/08/2014">
						<h2>Plano Mayor’s Summer Internship Program</h2>
						<em>Jun 2017- Jun 2018</em>
						<p>	
							I was one of the very few students who received two internships through the competitive program. After my internships, I was even asked to host events for the Program and to help with outreach events as an ambassador! I gained public speaking skills and even gained recognition from the Mayor of Plano and received a letter of Recommendation from him for all of my work within the program.
